            <p>“The one astonishing impact of Chinese development is poverty alleviation, not only in China, but also on a global level. China has brought 700 million people out of poverty. This is a great achievement. Not only in regards to the poverty level, but the living conditions of 1.4 billion people has also been substantially improved,” said Paudyal.</p>
